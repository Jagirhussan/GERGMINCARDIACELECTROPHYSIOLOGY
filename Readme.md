Simplifying the process of going from cells to tissues using statistical mechanics
========================================

Repository contains code used in the demonstration of applying *Exponetial Random Graph Models* to characterise substrate driven electrophysiology.

The **python** directory includes the code for generating electrophysiological wave patterns, sampling and causal graph generation.
************************************************

Electrophysiology model is based on the work of 
*K Christensen, KA Manani, NS Peters, Simple Model for Identifying Critical Regions in Atrial Fibrillation, PRL 2016*. 

The code at [CAAF](https://github.com/KishManani/CAAF) was modified to use cell specific refractory period <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=45\pm5">, store state values to create the timeseries, and utility functions to generate causal graphs from these state values.

`[Tigramite](https://jakobrunge.github.io/tigramite/) package was used for computing the causal graphs using Partial Correlation based Momentary Conditional Independence (PCMCI).

The **R** directory includes code to building ERGM's based on the causal graphs generated by the python code.
**********************************

The R code uses the [GERGM](https://github.com/matthewjdenny/GERGM) package. A bash script is also provided to launch multiple jobs as building GERGMs can be time consuming.
